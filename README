tabtweet uses jQuery to add an @name autocomplete box to Twitter.

It is both a chrom{e,ium} extension (in the chromium directory) and a
greasemonkey user script (in the grease folder). The former has an
OAuthentication functionality for users who protect their tweets; the latter
does not. The latter is also not done as of the creation of this README. Enjoy
:)
